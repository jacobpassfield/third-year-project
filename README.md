Questions so far:
1. What do the headers mean in the main data file?
This step is stopping me from progressing. I cannot decide which variables are fixed or random because I don't know what they are.
2. What is the body size variable?
3. What is the response variable in this scenario? Temperature's effect on body size.
4. There are 332 species. Do I make 332 seperate graphs? 
This week I knew what I needed to do, I just couldn't do it.
Need to reschedule my week to prioritise this a little more.
