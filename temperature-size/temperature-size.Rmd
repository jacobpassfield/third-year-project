The following report uses the ideas and data from a report found at *https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1171-0*. It follows the example given at *https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/mixed-models/*.

# Exploring the data

```{r}
load(file = "_data/fish_data.RData")
```

I want to investigate how temperature affects the size of different fish species.
